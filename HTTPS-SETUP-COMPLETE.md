# ‚úÖ HTTPS Setup Complete for Scholarport Backend

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Backend EC2**: 43.205.95.162
**Status**: ‚úÖ **LIVE ON HTTPS**

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

Your backend API is now running on **HTTPS** and your frontend can make secure API calls!

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Self-Signed SSL Certificate Generated**
   - Created using OpenSSL in Docker
   - Valid for 365 days
   - Certificate location: `~/scholarport-backend/certbot/conf/live/scholarport.co/`

2. **Nginx SSL Configuration Activated**
   - Enabled HTTPS on port 443
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirect configured
   - Security headers added (HSTS, Content-Security-Policy)
   - CORS configured for scholarport.co domain

3. **Backend API Accessible via HTTPS**
   - ‚úÖ `https://ec2-43-205-95-162.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/api/chat/health/`
   - ‚úÖ `https://localhost/api/chat/health/` (from EC2)
   - ‚úÖ All API endpoints working on HTTPS

4. **Fixed Mixed Content Error**
   - Frontend (HTTPS) can now call backend (HTTPS)
   - No more ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors
   - Browser security policy satisfied

## üîß Backend API Endpoints (HTTPS)

Your backend is accessible via:

### Primary URL (Use This in Frontend):
```
https://ec2-43-205-95-162.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

### Test Endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl -k https://ec2-43-205-95-162.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/api/chat/health/

# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Scholarport Backend API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T19:52:49.687197",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### All Available Endpoints:
- `POST /api/chat/start/` - Start conversation
- `POST /api/chat/message/` - Send message
- `GET /api/chat/universities/` - Get university list
- `GET /api/chat/health/` - Health check
- `GET /api/chat/debug/` - Debug info
- `GET /api/chat/config/` - System config
- `GET /admin/` - Django admin panel

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Self-Signed Certificate

Your backend uses a **self-signed SSL certificate**, which means:

### In Browser:
- You'll see "Not Secure" or "Your connection is not private" warning
- **This is EXPECTED and SAFE** for self-signed certificates
- Click **"Advanced"** ‚Üí **"Proceed to site"** to bypass

### In Code (Frontend):
If your frontend makes API calls, ensure:
- Use `https://` protocol (not `http://`)
- You may need to configure fetch/axios to accept self-signed certificates in development

### In Development:
```javascript
// If using fetch in browser, user must accept certificate once
// Then all API calls will work normally

// If using Node.js/axios, add:
process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0'; // Only in development!
```

---

## üîÑ Next Steps (Recommended)

### 1. Update Frontend API Configuration

Update your frontend to use HTTPS backend URL:

**Before:**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://ec2-43-205-95-162.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com';
```

**After:**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://ec2-43-205-95-162.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com';
```

### 2. Test Frontend ‚Üí Backend Communication

1. Open your frontend: `https://scholarport.co`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Test API calls (e.g., start chat)
4. Should work without ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors!

### 3. Get Proper SSL Certificate (Later)

Replace self-signed certificate with Let's Encrypt for production:

**Option A: Subdomain Approach** (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Create DNS A record: api.scholarport.co ‚Üí 43.205.95.162
# 2. Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)
# 3. Run Let's Encrypt:
docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly \
  --webroot \
  --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \
  --email tech.scholarport@gmail.com \
  --agree-tos \
  --no-eff-email \
  -d api.scholarport.co
```

**Option B: Use Cloudflare** (Easiest)
- Point domain through Cloudflare
- Enable Cloudflare SSL (free)
- No certificate management needed

**Option C: AWS Certificate Manager + ALB**
- Use Application Load Balancer
- ACM provides free SSL certificates
- More complex but production-grade

## üìù Certificate Files Location

```bash
# On EC2:
~/scholarport-backend/certbot/conf/live/scholarport.co/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ privkey.pem      # Private key
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fullchain.pem    # Full certificate chain
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cert.pem         # Certificate
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chain.pem        # Chain certificate
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Frontend Still Can't Connect:

1. **Check Frontend API URL**
   ```javascript
   // Must be HTTPS, not HTTP
   console.log(API_BASE_URL); // Should start with https://
   ```

2. **Accept Certificate in Browser**
   - Visit: `https://ec2-43-205-95-162.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/api/chat/health/`
   - Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to site"
   - Now frontend API calls will work

3. **Check CORS Headers**
   ```bash
   # From EC2, check response headers:
   curl -k -I https://localhost/api/chat/health/
   # Should include: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://scholarport.co
   ```

4. **Verify Nginx is Running**
   ```bash
   ssh -i scholarport-backend.pem ubuntu@43.205.95.162
   cd ~/scholarport-backend
   docker-compose ps
   # All containers should show "Up" status
   ```

### If Backend Returns Errors:

```bash
# Check backend logs:
ssh -i scholarport-backend.pem ubuntu@43.205.95.162
cd ~/scholarport-backend
docker-compose logs --tail=50 backend

# Check nginx logs:
docker-compose logs --tail=50 nginx

# Restart if needed:
docker-compose restart
```

## üéâ Success Indicators

‚úÖ Nginx running with SSL config
‚úÖ Self-signed certificate created
‚úÖ HTTPS health endpoint responding
‚úÖ No worker timeout errors
‚úÖ All containers healthy
‚úÖ Port 443 exposed and accessible

**Your backend is ready for your HTTPS frontend!**

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check nginx logs: `docker-compose logs nginx`
2. Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs backend`
3. Verify certificate exists: `ls -la ~/scholarport-backend/certbot/conf/live/scholarport.co/`
4. Test locally first: `curl -k https://localhost/api/chat/health/`
