# Scholarport Backend Nginx Configuration
# This file is DISABLED - using http-with-static.conf and scholarport-ssl.conf instead
# Keeping this file empty to avoid conflicts with missing SSL certificates

# NOTE: The api.scholarport.com SSL certificates don't exist
# If you need this config, first obtain SSL certs for the domain
