# DISABLED: This config has been replaced by http-with-static.conf
# The catch-all server_name _ was causing conflicts with specific configurations
#
# To re-enable, rename this file back to production.conf.active
# and remove the duplicate server blocks in other config files

# Original config is preserved below but commented out:
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     server_name _;
#     ...
# }
